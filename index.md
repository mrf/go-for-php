# Background
##
"Most interesting thing about Go is that it's not object oriented or procedural or functional, it's its own new exciting thing"
- David Kinzer https://twitter.com/dtkinzer/status/786031866478407681
##
"with Go I was able to pick up programming / CS concepts rather quickly, enjoy the process, and learn a ton of things in the meantime"
- Audrey Lim  https://youtu.be/fZh8uCInEfw
##
"Although Go is quite a small language, it is a very rich and expressive language (as measured in syntactic constructs, concepts, and idioms), so there is a surprising amount to learn."
- Freddy Rangel http://spaces-vs-tabs.com/4-weeks-of-golang-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/
##
"Even if youâ€™re a dynamic language zealot, I bet youâ€™d be shocked how productive you can be with a statically typed language like Go."
- Blake Smith http://blakesmith.me/2012/08/19/why-you-should-learn-to-program-in-go.html
##
"Golang is a very pleasant language to get systems-y things done in. I'm fond of saying that it's not an amazing language, but is an amazing programming tool."
- tptacek https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9381093
##
"When launching a new language it is important that the target audience be able to learn it quickly; rooting Go in the C family helps make sure that young programmers, most of whom know Java, JavaScript, and maybe C, should find Go easy to learn."
- Rob Pike https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article#TOC_12.

# Hello World
## Download: https://golang.org/doc/install
## untar it in /usr/local
## Tell Shell about Go
`$ export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin`

## Tell Go where your code is
`$ export GOPATH=$HOME/work`


## `go fmt`
- Pollution (won't allow unnused things)
- Tabs vs Spaces (WHO CARES)
- One standard to rule them all

## 
```
package main

import "fmt"
import "github.com/4ad/doozer"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, ä¸–ç•Œ")
}
```

## `go install`

## `go run`

## `go build`

# declaration plus assignment operator (:=)
 In Go, := is for declaration + assignment, whereas = is only for assignment only.


# CSP

```
// A _goroutine_ is a lightweight thread of execution.

package main

import "fmt"

func f(from string) {
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {
        fmt.Println(from, ":", i)
    }
}

func main() {

    // Suppose we have a function call `f(s)`. Here's how
    // we'd call that in the usual way, running it
    // synchronously.
    f("direct")

    // To invoke this function in a goroutine, use
    // `go f(s)`. This new goroutine will execute
    // concurrently with the calling one.
    go f("goroutine")

    // You can also start a goroutine for an anonymous
    // function call.
    go func(msg string) {
        fmt.Println(msg)
    }("going")

    // Our two function calls are running asynchronously in
    // separate goroutines now, so execution falls through
    // to here. This `Scanln` code requires we press a key
    // before the program exits.
    var input string
    fmt.Scanln(&input)
    fmt.Println("done")
}
